fig 1. there are many diverse states, and traditonal metrics can't capture them well

- raw traces showing diverse states
- scatterplots of metrics + highlighting examples 

fig 2. embedding as a technique to study diversity of spiking dynamics 

main fig: 

- show cartoon of workflow and how we do the analysis 
- embeddding + color by same metric we used in fig 1 
- should show the same examples we showed in fig 1 (show their locations)


supplemental:

1. why histograms don't work, why we use percentiles 

fig 3: identifieing states in the map

- show embedding + color by label


supplemental: 

2. re-embedding with different parameters
3. embedding of synthetic data 
4. visualization of ISIs of identified clusters
