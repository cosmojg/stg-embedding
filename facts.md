## Modulation

- STG is multiple modulated, many substances are both hormones and NT (review by Marder)
- Dopamaine and pilocarpine have differnet effects on electrically coupled neurons (AB and PD) in Panularis  (Eisen & Marder 1984)
- Dopamine excites AB, inhibits PD in Panularis (Eisen & Marder 1984)
- Pilocarpine or 5-HT can start a rhythm in an isolated, silent AB in Panularis. So intrinsic propoerties can be modulated. (Marder et al 1987)
- ONe modualtor can have many actions, one neruon is the target of many modulators (Marder, Bucher 2007 Ann Rev Phsyiol)
- Different modulators can elicit noticebaly different rhythms in the same prep in crabs (Marder & Weimann 1992)
- In Panularis, pyloric rhythm completely stops when stn is blocked 
- Different motor patterns with DA, 5-HT, and octopamine in panulairs (Ayali...Harris-Warrick 1999)
- Monoamine modualtors: dopamine, octopmaine, serotonin
- Monoamine modualtors affect most (all?) neurons, different effects in different neurons (Flamm & Harris-Warrickl 1986)
- Dopamine alters I_A current kinetics & activation in PY neurons (Harris-Warrick et al 1995) (it also affects other currents)
- DA & 5-HT bursting looks similar, but if you perturb it, you see differences: DA rhythm goes silent in low Ca, but 5-HT does not. DA rhythm persists in TTX, but 5-HT ryhthm does not (Harris-Warrick & Flamm 1987)
- Dopamine can have many different effects on pyloric synapses: enhanement, abolition, reduction, creation, sign reversal, etc. (see Bruce Johnson ) & Harris-Warrick?
- 5-HT depresses PD-> LP synapse (Kvarta et al 2012)
- DA doesn't change the synapse strength of PD->LP synapse, but changes its dynamics (Kvarta et al 2012)
- Bath applying proctoin activates, strengthens rhtyhm (Marder, Hoope, Siwicki 1986)
- Bath applying proctolin is similar to proctolin release from MPN neurons (Nusbaum & Marder J Neuro 1989) but it is not always the same ... proctolin release from MCN1 and MCN7 elicit different rhythms (Blitz et al 1999 J Neuro)
- MCN1-elicited and MPN-elicited pyloric rhythms can be a little different, evne though they both use the same neurotransmitter (GABA, proctolin) (Wood, Stein, Nusbaum J Neuro 2000)
